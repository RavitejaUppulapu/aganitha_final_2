            <p>
                By signing the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden is delivering on his promise to build an economy
                that works for working families, including Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA and
                NHPI) families. The Inflation Reduction Act lowers prescription drug costs, health care costs, and
                energy costs. It’s the most aggressive action we have taken to confront the climate crisis. It’ll lower
                the deficit and ask the super wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share. And no one making under
                $400,000 per year will pay a penny more in taxes.
            </p>
            <p>
                President Biden and Congressional Democrats beat back the special interests to pass this historic
                legislation that lowers costs for Americans and their families, advances environmental justice while
                building a cleaner future, and grows the economy from the bottom up and the middle out.

            <h2>LOWER HEALTH CARE COSTS</h2>
            <p>The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will lower health care costs, including prescription drug costs, and expand health insurance coverage for AA and NHPI families.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Caps the amount that seniors will have to pay for prescription drugs they buy at the pharmacy at $2,000 a year.</li>
                <li>Caps the amount that seniors will have to pay for insulin at $35 for a month’s supply.</li>
                <li>Provides access to additional free vaccines, including the shingles vaccine, for Medicare beneficiaries.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="second-section">
            <h2>MAKE THE TAX CODE FAIRER</h2>
            <p>President Trump and Congressional Republicans’ 2017 tax law only made an unfair tax system worse. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is a critical step forward in making our tax code fairer.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Ensuring that high-income people and large corporations pay the taxes they already owe.</li>
                <li>Cracking down on large, profitable corporations that currently get away with paying no federal income tax.</li>
                <li>Imposing a 1% surcharge on corporate stock buybacks that will encourage businesses to invest.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Millions of working families will have better access to the benefits they are entitled to under the tax code.</p>
